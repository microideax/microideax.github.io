# GEMINI.md

## Directory Overview

This directory contains the source code for a personal academic website. It appears to be for Yao Chen (陈瑶), a Research Assistant Professor at the National University of Singapore (NUS). The website is a static site built with HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. It is likely hosted on GitHub Pages, given the repository name `microideax.github.io`.

The website features a tabbed navigation system and supports both English and Chinese languages.

The `bak` directory contains a backup of a different website, for a conference called "CACM-EAO-2022". This seems unrelated to the personal website in the root directory.

## Key Files

*   `index.html`: The main entry point of the website. It contains the basic structure of the page, including the header, navigation tabs, and content sections for "Home", "Funding", "Teaching", "Services", "Publicity", "Awards", and "Misc".
*   `publication.html`: This file is loaded into an `iframe` in the "Publication" tab of `index.html`. It contains a list of academic publications.
*   `publicity.html`: This file contains a list of invited talks and presentations. The content is duplicated in the `index.html` file under the "Publicity" tab.
*   `style.css`: This file contains all the CSS styles for the website, controlling the layout, fonts, colors, and other visual aspects.
*   `Yao-Homepage_files/`: This directory contains assets for the website, such as images.

## Usage

This is a static website. To view the website, you can open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

To make changes to the website, you can edit the HTML and CSS files directly. There is no build process or dependency management system in place.
