<!-- This is Yao Chen's homepage. -->
I am a Research Scientist with the Advanced Digital Sciences Center (ADSC), a research center of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) based in Singapore. 
Currently, I am leading the Hardware and Data Analytics groups of ADSC on quite some attractive research topics under the supervision of Prof. Deming Chen and Prof. Marianne Winslett.

I got my BS and Ph.D. degree in Electronic Science and Technology from Nankai University in 2010 and 2016, respectively.
I was also a visiting scholar of the ECE department of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from 2013 to 2015.
